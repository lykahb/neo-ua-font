# Ukrainian font for Neo

Install with [neotools](https://github.com/lykahb/neotools) as an applet.

The Mac variant has ґ to the left of 1.

The PC variant has ' to the left of 1 and ґ to the right of ї.

The font is based on the [Cyrillic font](https://www.flickr.com/groups/alphasmart/discuss/72157691753726892/) by Alexander Kalgin. Other than adding the Ukrainian letters, this font also improves the shapes of several letters (б, м) for consistency with the rest of the font. Created with cross-platform [neo-font-editor](https://github.com/mls-m5/neo-font-editor).
